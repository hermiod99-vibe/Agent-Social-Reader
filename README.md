## 🎯 Quick Overview

As a knowledge worker, product manager, or heavy AI agent user, the moment you drop an X (Twitter), Reddit, WeChat article, or Xiaohongshu link into your AI, you hit walls: login barriers, anti-scraping blocks, IP bans, or HTML garbage. On top of that, you're stuck maintaining a separate tool for every single platform.

**The problem this Skill solves:**

❌ Before:

```
You: drop a Twitter/Reddit/Xiaohongshu link into your agent
Agent: "I can't access that" / returns garbled HTML
You: resort to manual copy-paste, screenshots, or give up
```

✅ Now:

```
You: drop any social media link into your agent
Agent: reads automatically → summarizes automatically
You: save it to Notion / Obsidian / ima
→ content neatly filed in your knowledge base
```

**Core value**:
- ✅ **Complete loop**: Read → Summarize → Archive — end-to-end in one workflow
- ✅ **Broad coverage**: 20+ global social platforms (TikTok, Instagram, X, YouTube, Reddit, Douyin, Xiaohongshu, Bilibili...)
- ✅ **Lower account risk**: No need to log in to personal social accounts, no cookie required — reduces risk of suspension from cookie-based access
- ✅ **Flexible cost**: Free tools first; optional paid enhancements from $2.90/month

> 💡 **Design philosophy**: Use free tools wherever possible; reach for the most cost-effective paid option only when free tools won't do. You decide which tier to use.

> ❤️ **Special thanks to** [Agent-Reach](https://github.com/Panniantong/Agent-Reach) by [@Panniantong](https://github.com/Panniantong). Agent-Reach proved that getting an AI agent to read web content was achievable — this project is a personal iteration on the same idea, with a tighter focus on social content reading and knowledge base archiving.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Install the Skill (10 seconds)

Copy and paste this into whichever AI agent you're using (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenClaw, Hermes Agent, WorkBuddy, etc.):

```
Install the Agent-Social-Reader Skill: https://github.com/hermiod99-vibe/Agent-Social-Reader
```

That's it. Your agent handles everything else.

---

### Step 2: Start using it immediately (free right away)

After installation, these features work at no cost:

- "Show me what's on this tweet"
- "Summarize this WeChat article"
- "What does this webpage say?"
- "Subscribe to this RSS feed"

---

### Step 3: Optional enhancements (as needed)

#### 🔓 Unlock 20+ social platform reading (TikTok, Reddit, Instagram, Douyin, Xiaohongshu, Bilibili, etc.; X/Twitter single public posts, Weibo posts, WeChat Official Account articles use the free tool path first)

The first time you ask your agent to read from these platforms, it will prompt:

> "This platform requires an AgentLens API key to read. It unlocks 20+ major social platforms. Get your free API key in 10 seconds at https://agentlensapi.io/pricing — 20 requests/month free; paid plans from $2.90/month (200 requests), see pricing page. Once you paste it here, I'll handle the rest."

Full pricing: [agentlensapi.io/pricing](https://agentlensapi.io/pricing)

---

#### 🎥 Unlock video summarization (TikTok, YouTube, and other videos without subtitles)

Two options:

**Option A: Completely free (requires setup)**

Install Whisper locally:

```bash
pip install faster-whisper
# macOS: brew install ffmpeg | Ubuntu: sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

Once installed, tell your agent:

> "I've installed local Whisper, running in CPU mode."

If your current agent supports preference memory and you confirm, your agent can remember your preference. Going forward, when it encounters a video without subtitles, it automatically follows: download → extract audio → transcribe locally → summarize.

> ⚠️ **Hardware notes**: Small models (tiny/base) run on any regular computer; large models (large-v3) are recommended with a GPU. On first use, the model downloads automatically (75MB–3GB).

**Option B: Paid & convenient (recommended for most users)**

Get a Whisper API Key from the [OpenAI platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and tell your agent:

> "Here's my OpenAI API Key: [YOUR_KEY]"

If your current agent supports preference memory and you confirm, your agent can remember your preference. Going forward, it automatically calls the API for any subtitle-free video.

> 💡 **Low cost**: ~$0.006/minute. A 1-minute TikTok costs ~$0.006; a 10-minute YouTube video costs ~$0.06.

---

#### 📁 Connect your knowledge base (Notion / Obsidian / ima)

The first time you say "save to Notion", "save to Obsidian", or "save to ima", your agent walks you through a one-time setup:

- **Notion**: requires an Integration Token and a Database ID or Page ID (credentials stored locally; direct end-to-end connection)
  💡 The default save script assumes your Notion database has a Title property named **Name** and a URL property named **Source**. If your database uses different property names or you want to save to a single page instead of a database, let your agent know during the first save.
- **Obsidian**: requires your local vault path
- **ima**: requires Client ID + API Key (scan QR code at ima.qq.com/agent-interface); ima is Tencent's knowledge base product, accessible from WeChat, Feishu, and WeCom

**ima — three access scenarios:**

| Scenario | Description |
|:---------|:-----------|
| Running inside ima directly | Zero config; use built-in ima skills |
| Running in WorkBuddy | One-time setup: Client ID + API Key |
| Running in another Agent (OpenClaw / Claude Code etc.) | One-time setup: Client ID + API Key + Knowledge Base ID |

For social links (Douyin/Xiaohongshu/X etc.), Markdown upload is recommended — content persists even if the original link goes dead. For regular web pages, URL import works fine.

Once configured in the same runtime environment, setup is typically one-time only.

---

### Step 4: One-time setup, automated going forward

Once you have configured everything and your agent successfully reads, summarizes, or saves its first piece of content, it will proactively ask:

> "Got everything sorted! To make things easier going forward, shall I set Agent-Social-Reader as my default tool for reading web and social content? If you confirm, I'll write this to long-term memory or your local preferences file. Then you can just drop me a link anytime and I'll handle the rest — no need to mention the Skill name each time."

Once you confirm, just speak naturally:

- "Show me what this tweet says"
- "Save this to Notion"
- "Save this to ima"

Your agent calls the right tool automatically. No need to specify the Skill name each time. Just say "save it to Notion" whenever you want.

## 👍🏻 My Daily Workflow

```
I share a link → Agent reads → Agent summarizes → I say "save to Notion" → it's in Notion
```

Content saved to Notion/Obsidian/ima includes:

- Original link
- Full text
- AI summary

Easy to search and review later.

## 💰 Pricing (Fully Transparent)

Per Skill marketplace guidelines, paid services require transparent pricing disclosure:

### Completely free features

- ✅ General web pages (r.jina.ai)
- ✅ Single public X/Twitter posts (FxTwitter API)
- ✅ YouTube videos with subtitles (youtube-transcript-api)
- ✅ Weibo (r.jina.ai)
- ✅ WeChat public accounts (Camoufox)
- ✅ RSS feeds (feedparser)
- ✅ Full-web search (Agent runtime built-in search)
- ✅ Notion/Obsidian/ima archiving
- ✅ Local Whisper video transcription (requires your own installation)

### Optional paid features

#### 📱 AgentLens API (20+ social platform reading)

| Plan | Requests/month | Price |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Free | 20 | $0 |
| Basic | 200 | $2.90/month |
| Ultra | 500 | $5.90/month |
| Mega | 1,000 | $9.90/month |

Full pricing: [agentlensapi.io/pricing](https://agentlensapi.io/pricing)

Why AgentLens (from my own experience):

- One API key for 20+ platforms (vs one tool per platform)
- No cookie required (vs risking account suspension)
- No proxy required (vs maintaining your own IP pool)
- Stable maintenance (vs tracking platform rule changes yourself)

For me, $2.90/month (200 requests, enough for a month) is excellent value for the peace of mind it brings.

---

#### 🎥 OpenAI Whisper API (video transcription)

- **Price**: ~$0.006/minute
- **Examples**:
  - 1-minute TikTok: $0.006
  - 10-minute YouTube: $0.06
  - 30-minute podcast: $0.18

Full pricing: [OpenAI Pricing — Whisper](https://platform.openai.com/docs/pricing)

## 💡 Design Philosophy

**Focus on completing the "read → summarize → archive" loop.**

Within this loop:

### Read layer (free-first)

| Content source | Tool | Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| General web pages | Jina Reader | ✅ Free |
| Public X/Twitter posts | FxTwitter API | ✅ Free |
| YouTube subtitles | youtube-transcript-api | ✅ Free |
| Weibo | r.jina.ai | ✅ Free |
| WeChat public accounts | Camoufox | ✅ Free |
| RSS feeds | feedparser | ✅ Free |
| 20+ social platforms | AgentLens API | 💵 Optional |

🔐 **Core advantage**: No social account login / no cookie used.
The underlying layer never requires you to log into any personal social account, enter a password, or provide a cookie — so platforms cannot trace activity back to your personal account, reducing the risk of suspension from using personal account cookies.

---

### Summarize layer (LLM calls)

| Content type | Method |
| :--- | :--- |
| Text, images | LLM summarizes directly |
| YouTube with subtitles | Subtitle text → LLM summarizes |
| Videos without subtitles | Audio transcription (✅ free locally, or 💵 optional paid API) → LLM summarizes |

---

### Archive layer (completely free)

Notion, Obsidian, and ima are all free. Just tell your agent "save to Notion", "save to Obsidian", or "save to ima" — it walks you through one-time setup. After that, just ask again whenever you want to save, and it writes automatically with no need to reconfigure.

Archived content includes:

- Original link
- Full text
- AI summary

ima is Tencent's knowledge base product: once configured, your archive is accessible across WeChat, Feishu, and WeCom. For social links, Markdown upload is recommended — content is saved directly and doesn't depend on the original link remaining accessible.

---

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- **Account safety (no login required)**: Many solutions require browser extensions or cookie exports to fetch content. This Skill never asks you to log into any personal social account or provide a cookie, which reduces the risk of suspension from cookie-based access.
- **End-to-end direct connection**: Whether it's your Notion Token, Obsidian local path, or ima Client ID + API Key — all credentials are strictly stored by your agent in a local file on your own machine (`~/.agent-social-reader/config.json` or environment variables). When making requests, your agent calls each service's API (Notion, OpenAI, AgentLens, ima, and any other configured service) directly from the current runtime environment — credentials are sent only to the corresponding service. Third-party services process data according to their own privacy policies.
